## Conventions

- Most read commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output.
- `-p / --project` scopes session subcommand lookups to one project.
- Session and project ids are shown by `ao session ls` and `ao project ls`.
- `--agent` is an alias for `--harness` on `ao spawn`.
- Every command accepts `-h / --help` for the full flag list.
